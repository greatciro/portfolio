# Cebu Province - Provincial Dashboard
This dashboard is created by yours genuinely, Cyrus Baruc, in completion of my data associate capstone course by the Development Academy of the Philippines
under project SPARTA.

Objective
To enable Cebu Province LGU to visualize the comparison between cities and municipalities and the relationship between the population, infrastructure, talents produced, and business environment.
The dashboard also offers highlights of each town and municipality regarding tourist attractions.
